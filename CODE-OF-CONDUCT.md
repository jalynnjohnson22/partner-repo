**Code of Conduct**

We are following the path of our peers, such as Microsoft and Google, and choosing to adopt the Contributor Covenant which can be found at: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/

We are making this decision because the Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, and thoroughly vetted. If we had tried to make our own code of conduct, it would likely contain flaws that the Contributor Covenant has fixed in its many updates. We want to encourage fellow programmers to use our project, and using a Code of Conduct most are familiar with helps users get accustomed to our project.
