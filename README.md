This is the shared repository for Jay Johnson and Carter Keith.

**About**

Our program takes in the name and birthday month of a user and gives some type of response based on how far away their birthday is.

**Installation**

In order to properly use this software on all devices, move the application folder on to your Desktop. Be sure to change the directory in your terminal to “Desktop” in order to run it correctly. If you have properly installed the program, run “birthday test” on the command line. If you get the following message, you have properly installed the program:

“Thank you for installing Birthday Hunt. You are currently in the Desktop directory, and successfully installed the program. It is ready for use.”
